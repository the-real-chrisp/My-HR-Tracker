## Description
    
I was motivated to build this project so that I could build a functional application to manage a database of employees in order to keep appropriate records. By creating this application, I no longer need to pay for a comparable product and thus save my business money. Throughout this project I learned more about Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL databases. Please checkout my application and I hope you find it useful.
